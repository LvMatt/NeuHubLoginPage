If in any case you have problem running project because of independancy tree:

If I would have more time I would implement few more things.
1. Routing - I would implement React Router to specify navigational components.
2. Animation - If I really would have more time, I would love to create an animation from the pictures. So it would be more dynamic.
3. Security - even though I made validation for Login forms, if I would dive much deeper and secured it more
4. Redux - for better state management
5. Password input - would add eye-switcher button so the customer can see the password
6. Checkbox - I would make round shape, now because I did not have time I used radio input
7. Registration - Link for registration in the case user does not have an account
